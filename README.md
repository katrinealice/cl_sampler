# Project repository to build a Gibbs sampler for $C_{\ell}$ and $a_{lm}$ spherical harmonic modes. 

Work in progress ...

Currently using the [GCR sampler](https://github.com/katrinealice/sph_harm_GCR) as a 'base' and updating it to include the $C_{\ell}$ sampling too. 

Current TODOs

#TODO update initial guess?
#TODO keep this for cl_sampler version? (referring to setting the ell=0 prior to set value)
#TODO set up all timing again!!
